PIR Stands for Passive infrared. This motion sensor consists of a fresnel lens, an infrared detector, and supporting detection circuitry. The lens on the sensor focuses any infrared radiation present around it toward the infrared detector. Our bodies generate infrared heat, and as a result, this heat is picked up by the motion sensor.The sensor outputs a 5V signal for a period of one minute as soon as it detects the presence of a person. It offers a tentative range of detection of about 6â€“7 meters and is highly sensitive. When the PIR motion sensor detects a person, it outputs a 5V signal to the Raspberry Pi through its GPIO and we define what the Raspberry Pi should do as it detects an intruder through the Python coding. Here we are just printing "Intruder detected". 



Step 1:
Blinking an LED Using the Raspberry Pi GPIO-Output GPIO Control

After you have set up your Raspberry Pi, we can now start messing around with its GPIO pins. Here, we will try to blink an LED using a Python script. Copy and paste the following code into your Raspberry Pi. (Refer to ledblink.py)


Step 2:


Next, we need to connect the LED to pin 3 on the Raspberry Pi GPIO.

You should notice that the LED starts blinking after you execute the Python program using this command: sudo python ledblink.py. The LED blinks because it receives a HIGH (5V) signal and a LOW (0V) signal from the Raspberry Pi GPIO at a delay of one second. You can check out the video below for a demo:
